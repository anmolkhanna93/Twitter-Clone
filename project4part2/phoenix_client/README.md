# PhoenixClient

- We have used phoenix channel client(https://github.com/ryo33/phoenix-channel-client) in order to connect to server using websocket.

- To initialize the client perform the following steps:
```
mix deps.get
mix escript.build
```

- To run the client give the command like:
```
./phoenix_client server_ip  i.e. ./phoenix_client 127.0.0.1
```
